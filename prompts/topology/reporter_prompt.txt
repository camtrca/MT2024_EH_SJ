You are an expert in graph theory. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine whether all nodes in the graph can be visited in a valid order according to the given dependencies. If such an ordering exists, provide the solution.

Original Problem:
"{original_problem}"

Accumulated Propositions:
{propositions_text}

Definition:
"A topology graph is a directed graph that defines dependencies between nodes, with each edge indicating a required visit order."

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the presence or absence of a valid topological ordering. Base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude whether all nodes can be visited in a valid order? Please answer with 'Yes' if a valid ordering exists, or 'No' if it does not. If yes, provide the ordering and a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by your reasoning and the ordering if applicable.

Example format:
"Yes. The valid ordering is: 0,3,4,2,1."

or

"No. A valid ordering is not possible because..."
