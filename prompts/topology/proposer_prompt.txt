You are a problem solver in graph theory. Based on the following partial graph, provide a proposition that will assist in determining whether all nodes can be visited in a valid order according to the given dependencies.

Your proposition should include:
- A clear and concise definition of a topological ordering, if not already provided: "A topology graph is a directed graph that defines dependencies between nodes, with each edge indicating a required visit order."
- Accurate statements of the given dependencies, matching exactly the partial graph provided.
- Logical analysis and observations based strictly on the given dependencies, aiming to identify whether a valid ordering exists.
- If possible, propose a valid ordering of the nodes.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and precise language.
- **If you can logically conclude whether all nodes can be visited in a valid order based on the given dependencies, you may state this conclusion and provide the ordering along with your reasoning.**
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is sound and valid.
- Present the ordering in a clear format, e.g., "The ordering can be: 0,1,2,3,4."

Partial Graph (Dependencies):
{partial_graph}

Question:
"Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution."

Please analyze the partial graph and provide observations or propositions based on the current information. Focus on exploring possible orderings and identifying any cycles or conflicts that may prevent a valid ordering.

Your response should:
- Be clear and concise.
- Build upon previous propositions without repeating them verbatim.
- Provide logical reasoning leading towards an answer.

Hypothesis:
{hypothesis}
