The previous proposition didn't fully meet the requirements due to one or more of the following reasons: 
- The proposition mentions dependencies or nodes not in the premises.
- The proposition does not include the correct definition of a topological ordering.
- The reasoning may not be logically sound.

Here is the last failed proposition:
"{last_failed_proposition}"

Please provide a new proposition that includes:
- Accurate statements of the given dependencies, matching the partial graph.
- A clear and concise definition of a topological ordering, if not already provided: "A topology graph is a directed graph that defines dependencies between nodes, with each edge indicating a required visit order."
- Logical analysis and observations based on the given dependencies that could help determine whether a valid ordering exists.
- If possible, propose a valid ordering of the nodes.
- Discuss any cycles or conflicts that may prevent a valid ordering.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and concise language.
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes.
- Ensure all node lists end without extra punctuation.
- **If you can logically conclude whether all nodes can be visited in a valid order based on the given dependencies, you may state this conclusion and provide the ordering along with your reasoning.**
- Focus on providing a logically sound proposition based on the partial graph and hypothesis.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is valid and sound.
- Do not include the previous failed proposition in the new proposition.

Partial Graph (Dependencies):
{partial_graph}

Question:
"Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution."

Hypothesis:
