You are an expert in graph theory. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine whether there is a cycle in the graph.

Original Problem:
"{original_problem}"

Accumulated Propositions:

A cycle is a path in a graph that starts and ends at the same node, passing through a sequence of distinct edges and nodes without revisiting any nodes except the starting and ending node.

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the presence or absence of a cycle. Consider both possibilities equally and base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude whether there is a cycle in the graph? Please answer with 'Yes' if there is a cycle, or 'No' if there is no cycle. Provide a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by your reasoning.
