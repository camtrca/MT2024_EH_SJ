You are an expert in graph theory. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine the maximum flow from node {source_node} to node {sink_node} in the graph.

Original Problem:
"{original_problem}"

Accumulated Propositions:
{propositions_text}

Definition:
"In a flow network, a flow represents the amount of something passing through the network from a source to a sink, respecting capacity constraints."

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the maximum flow from the source to the sink. Base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude what the maximum flow from node {source_node} to node {sink_node} is in the graph? Please provide the maximum flow value and a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with "The maximum flow from node {source_node} to node {sink_node} is {maximum_flow_value}." Followed by your reasoning.
