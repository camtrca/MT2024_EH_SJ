The previous proposition didn't fully meet the requirements due to one or more of the following reasons: 
- The proposition mentions edges or capacities not in the premises.
- The proposition does not include the correct definition of maximum flow in a network.
- The reasoning may not be logically sound.

Here is the last failed proposition:
"{last_failed_proposition}"

Please provide a new proposition that includes:
- Accurate statements of the node connections and capacities, matching the partial graph.
- A clear and concise definition of maximum flow in a network, if not already provided:"In a flow network, a flow represents the amount of something passing through the network from a source to a sink, respecting capacity constraints."
- Logical analysis and observations based on the given edges and capacities that could help determine the maximum flow from the source to the sink.
- Discuss any paths from the source to the sink, capacities of these paths, and identify any bottlenecks that limit the flow.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and concise language.
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes or capacities.
- Ensure all lists end without extra punctuation.
- **If you can logically calculate the maximum flow from the source to the sink based on the given edges and capacities, you may state this conclusion and provide your reasoning.**
- Focus on providing a logically sound proposition based on the partial graph and hypothesis.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is valid and sound.
- Do not include the previous failed proposition in the new proposition.
