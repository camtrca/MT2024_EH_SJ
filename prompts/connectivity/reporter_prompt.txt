You are an expert in graph theory. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine whether there is a path between node {node_a} and node {node_b} in the graph.

Original Problem:
"{original_problem}"

Accumulated Propositions:
{propositions_text}

Definition:
"A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices."

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the presence or absence of a path between the two nodes. Base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude whether there is a path between node {node_a} and node {node_b} in the graph? Please answer with 'Yes' if there is a path, or 'No' if there is no path. Provide a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by your reasoning.
