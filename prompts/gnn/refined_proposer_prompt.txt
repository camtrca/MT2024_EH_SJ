The previous proposition didn't fully meet the requirements due to one or more of the following reasons: 
- The proposition mentions nodes or embeddings not in the premises.
- The proposition does not include the correct definition of a simple graph convolution layer.
- The reasoning or calculations may not be logically sound.

Here is the last failed proposition:
"{last_failed_proposition}"

Please provide a new proposition that includes:
- Accurate statements of the node connections and initial embeddings, matching the partial graph.
- A clear and concise definition of a simple graph convolution layer, if not already provided: "A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a class of neural networks that operate on graph structures, leveraging the connections and features of nodes and edges."
- Logical analysis and step-by-step calculations based on the given edges and embeddings that determine the updated embeddings after each layer.
- Present the updated embeddings for each node after each layer in a clear format.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and concise language.
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes or embeddings.
- Ensure all lists end without extra punctuation.
- **If you can logically calculate the embeddings of each node after the specified number of layers based on the given information, you may provide these embeddings along with your reasoning.**
- Focus on providing a logically sound proposition based on the partial graph and hypothesis.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning and calculations are valid and accurate.
- Do not include the previous failed proposition in the new proposition.
