You are an expert in graph theory and machine learning. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine the embeddings of each node after {num_layers} layers of a simple graph convolution layer.

Original Problem:
"{original_problem}"

Accumulated Propositions:
{propositions_text}

Definition:
"A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a class of neural networks that operate on graph structures, leveraging the connections and features of nodes and edges."

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the updated embeddings of each node after each layer. Base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude what the embeddings of each node are after {num_layers} layers? Please provide the embeddings for each node along with a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with "After {num_layers} layers, the embeddings of each node are:" followed by the list of nodes and their embeddings.

Example format:
"After 2 layers, the embeddings of each node are:
node 0: [x, y]
node 1: [x, y]
..."
