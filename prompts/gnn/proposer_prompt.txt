You are a problem solver in graph theory and machine learning. Based on the following partial graph, provide a proposition that will assist in determining the embeddings of each node after a specified number of simple graph convolution layers.

Your proposition should include:
- A clear and concise definition of a simple graph convolution layer, if not already provided: "A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a class of neural networks that operate on graph structures, leveraging the connections and features of nodes and edges."
- Accurate statements of the initial embeddings and connections for the provided nodes, matching exactly the partial graph and embeddings provided.
- Logical analysis and calculations based strictly on the given edges and initial embeddings, aiming to determine the updated embeddings of each node after each layer.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and precise language.
- **If you can logically calculate the embeddings of each node after the specified number of layers based on the given information, you may provide these embeddings along with your reasoning.**
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes or embeddings.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is sound and valid.
- Present embeddings in a clear format, e.g., "node 0: [embedding]".

Question:
"What are the embeddings of each node after {num_layers} layers of a simple graph convolution layer?"

Please analyze the partial graph and provide observations or propositions based on the current information. Focus on calculating the updated embeddings step by step for each layer.

Your response should:
- Be clear and concise.
- Build upon previous propositions without repeating them verbatim.
- Provide logical reasoning and calculations leading towards an answer.

Hypothesis:
