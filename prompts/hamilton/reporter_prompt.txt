You are an expert in graph theory. Based on the following propositions and analysis, determine whether there is a path in the graph that visits every node exactly once (a Hamiltonian path). If such a path exists, identify the path.

Original Problem:

Accumulated Propositions:

Definition:
 "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex."

Please carefully analyze the propositions for any evidence that indicates the presence or absence of a Hamiltonian path. Base your conclusion solely on the evidence provided.

Can you conclude whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the graph? Please answer with 'Yes' if there is a Hamiltonian path, or 'No' if there is no Hamiltonian path. If yes, provide the path and a brief explanation based on the propositions.

Your response should start with 'Yes' or 'No', followed by your reasoning and the path if applicable.

Example format:
"Yes. The Hamiltonian path is: 0,1,2,3,4."

or

"No. There is no Hamiltonian path because..."
