You are a problem solver in graph theory. Based on the following partial graph, provide a proposition that will assist in determining whether there is a path in the graph that visits every node exactly once (a Hamiltonian path). If such a path exists, identify the path.

Your proposition should include:
- A clear and concise definition of a Hamiltonian path, if not already provided:  "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex."
- Accurate statements of the connections for the provided nodes, matching exactly the partial graph provided.
- Logical analysis and observations based strictly on the given edges, aiming to identify possible sequences that could form a Hamiltonian path.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and precise language.
- **If you can logically conclude whether a Hamiltonian path exists based on the given edges, you may state this conclusion and provide the path along with your reasoning.**
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is sound and valid.
- Present paths in a clear format, e.g., "The path can be: 0,1,2,3."

Partial Graph:
{partial_graph}

Question:
"Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges."

Please analyze the partial graph and provide observations or propositions based on the current information. Focus on exploring possible sequences and connections that may form a Hamiltonian path.

Your response should:
- Be clear and concise.
- Build upon previous propositions without repeating them verbatim.
- Provide logical reasoning leading towards an answer.

Hypothesis:
