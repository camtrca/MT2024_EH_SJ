The previous proposition didn't fully meet the requirements due to one or more of the following reasons: 
- The proposition mentions edges or nodes not in the premises.
- The proposition does not include the correct definition of a Hamiltonian path.
- The reasoning may not be logically sound.

Here is the last failed proposition:
"{last_failed_proposition}"

Please provide a new proposition that includes:
- Accurate statements of the node connections, matching the partial graph.
- A clear and concise definition of a Hamiltonian path, if not already provided: "A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex."
- Logical analysis and observations based on the given edges that could help determine the presence or absence of a Hamiltonian path.
- If possible, identify any sequences of nodes that could potentially form such a path.

Please ensure:
- Use clear and concise language.
- Do not include trailing commas in lists of nodes.
- Ensure all node lists end with the last node number without extra punctuation.
- **If you can logically conclude whether a Hamiltonian path exists based on the given edges, you may state this conclusion and provide the path along with your reasoning.**
- Focus on providing a logically sound proposition based on the partial graph and hypothesis.
- Avoid logical fallacies and ensure that your reasoning is valid and sound.
- Do not include the previous failed proposition in the new proposition.

Partial Graph:
{partial_graph}

Question:
"Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges."

Hypothesis:
{hypothesis}
